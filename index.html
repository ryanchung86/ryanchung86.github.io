            I'm fantastic... ally enthusiastic about web development.
            I recently completed a full-time web development course at Bitmaker Labs, which really opened my eyes to the incredible things that languages like Ruby and Javascript can do.
            It's also shown me what I'm capable of when I really care about and enjoy what I'm doing. Amazing digital projects are coming to life in my hometown of Toronto, and I wanna be in the room where it happens.

                      First passion: Movies. It's pretty great when your classroom is a theatre, and the lessons are being taught by Eisenstein, Buster Keaton, Hitchcock, Spielberg.
                      I learned a lot about the art and history of film and I like using what I learned to blog about or share my thoughts on the movies I see on social media.
                      Much of my online reading is film related, even after all these years.

                    <p>
                      So here's the story: Poker on TV was really starting to grow in popularity when I was in high school ("Did you hear a guy named Chris Moneymaker turned $86 into millions by winning a seat to the World Series of Poker on the internet?!"),
                      and in Grade 12 some friends and I would get together during spare periods and play Texas Hold'em. What started out as a fun pastime quickly become a second passion.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      I started playing online with play money chips, and the site I was playing on gave me $5 for free as part of some promotion.
                      I studied the game more and more, practiced good money management, and was able to turn that $5 into enough to eventually play in the World Series of Poker myself!
                      And even though I didn't win millions (or anything that week), it was a pretty unforgettable experience, one I hope to have again in the near future. I still play
                      the occasional tournament every now and then.

                      I was successful playing poker, but I knew it was unsustainable in the long run, so I decided to go back to school, enrolling in this post graduate program and provided me with
                      a wide-ranging overview of the digital media industry. I enjoyed learning about UX Design, analytics, content strategy, and even got to write and direct a short film. I also learned
                      about some of the fundamentals of web development, but it wasn't enough to fully satisfy...

                      I got this opportunity to work on a digital conversion project for the Ontario Government, and it was no small feat.
                      We had to make our way through 15 years worth of government publications, transferring them to documents that were not only
                      HTML-compatible but that met online accessibility standards. It was repetitive and occasionally frustrating, but I was working with a team
                      of great people, and we got the job done.

                    Which brings me back to web development. Even before going back to school I had some interest in coding, writing HTML markup for my profiles on platforms that preceded Facebook and Friendster(!).
                    I learned a lot about the tech industry at Centennial, but I didn't feel like I had the tangible skills that would open the doors of the kinds of companies I wanted to work at, so I enrolled
                    at Bitmaker. I'd heard about it from a friend who took a leap, made a big career change and has since moved on to great success.

                    So here I am telling you, dear reader, a snippet of my life story, on a webpage that a few months ago I never would have been able to write (even with the help of powerful frameworks like Bootstrap),
                    showcasing web apps that I didn't know was possible without years of study. The lessons may be over but the learning continues.
